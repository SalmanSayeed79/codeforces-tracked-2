# CodeforcesTracked Web App
A complete solution to the codeforces users that has many functionailties like saving certain problems, tracking my friends, visiting my account details, searching for submissions and saving them for later use. 

## Project Overview
----
Codeforces Tracked is an all round solution for our users who are looking to track their progress and comparing themselves to their friends.
The services are : 
- #### Viewing others
    This service gives our users the ability to track other codeforces users using just their handlenames. Our users can just input the handlename of the user they want to track and they will get the last 50 problems that the user had successfully completed
- #### Saving Accounts
    This is the second service that "Codeforces Tracked" provides. In this service, our users can save handlenames of their friends and can view their updates just at the click of a button

- #### Saving Problems
    In this, our users can save a problem and see that problem at any time whenever they want. This lets our users store the problems that they want to solve later on.
- #### Authentication
    We have the ability to authenticate users and the authentication works on multiple devices. The auth state stays saved and users don't have to login each time. They can logout any time and login into their other accounts too.



## Challenges
---
Around the globe energy deficiency is one of the most severe problems. Since because of globalization, it is impossible to prosper without the usage data. However, data is not accessible nor understandable to all of the population. Inaccessibility to solar data gives birth to a lot of challenges.
#### Inability to save problems
Users cannot save a particular problem in the existing codeforces website. They have to save the link and click on the link later on
#### Inaccessibility of Other user data
In normal codeforces website we can not see the data of other users. We can see their basic data but not the whole thing. We cannot also see the past few problems that the particular user had solved
   
## Solution
---
This is exactly where "Codeforces Tracked" comes in. We can give our users the ability to save certain problems, their friends, certain problems into their codeforces tracked account
## Architecture
